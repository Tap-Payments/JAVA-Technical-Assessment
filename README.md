# Part1 Algorithm Task

# Task Title
Write efficient function takes stock prices yesterday returns best profit

## Task descriptioin
Suppose we could access yesterdayâ€™s stock prices as a list, where:
 - The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
 - The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
 
 So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500. Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best    profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
    # get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
   returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
